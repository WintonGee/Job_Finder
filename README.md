# Job Finder
Job Finder is a personal project designed to streamline the job search process by automating and organizing job discovery. While automation tools have accelerated my application submissions, identifying high-quality job opportunities remains the primary bottleneck. This project aims to address that by making the discovery process faster, more efficient, and better organized.
